### 4. Report Submission - NEEDS SQL ⚠️

**The Code is Ready ✅**
All code is fixed and working. You just need to run the SQL script.

**🚨 CRITICAL: Run This SQL in Supabase Dashboard**

```sql
-- Enable RLS on reports table
ALTER TABLE reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own reports" ON reports;

-- Allow anyone to view all reports
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view reports"
ON reports FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to insert reports
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert reports"
ON reports FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to update their own reports
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own reports"
ON reports FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to delete their own reports
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own reports"
ON reports FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**How to run:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
4. Paste the SQL above
5. Click "RUN" or press Ctrl+Enter
6. Done! ✅
