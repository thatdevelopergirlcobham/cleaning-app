# üö® URGENT: Fix Report Submission NOW

## Why Reports Are Not Working

**The code is 100% ready ‚úÖ**  
**BUT: You need to run the SQL script in Supabase! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Your database has Row Level Security (RLS) enabled, which is blocking report submissions because the policies haven't been set up yet.

## üîß Fix It Now (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Look for **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
4. Click it

### Step 2: Copy This SQL Script

```sql
-- Enable RLS on reports table
ALTER TABLE reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own reports" ON reports;

-- Allow anyone to view all reports
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view reports"
ON reports FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to insert reports
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert reports"
ON reports FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to update their own reports
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own reports"
ON reports FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to delete their own reports
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own reports"
ON reports FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Step 3: Run the Script
1. Paste the SQL above into the SQL Editor
2. Click **"RUN"** button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
3. Wait for "Success" message
4. Done! ‚úÖ

## üîç What Was Blocking Reports?

### Before (Without SQL):
```
User tries to submit report
  ‚Üì
Supabase checks RLS policies
  ‚Üì
‚ùå No policy found for INSERT
  ‚Üì
‚ùå Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"
  ‚Üì
‚ùå Report NOT saved
```

### After (With SQL):
```
User tries to submit report
  ‚Üì
Supabase checks RLS policies
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Policy found: "Authenticated users can insert reports"
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ User is authenticated
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Report SAVED successfully!
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### Issue: "relation 'reports' does not exist"
**Solution:** Your reports table isn't created yet. Create it first:

```sql
CREATE TABLE reports (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  image_url TEXT,
  location JSONB,
  latitude DECIMAL,
  longitude DECIMAL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Then run the RLS policies script.

### Issue: "permission denied for table reports"
**Solution:** You're not logged in as the database owner. Make sure you're using the Supabase dashboard with the correct project.
