# ✅ Protected Route Fix - No More Infinite Loader!

## Problem
ProtectedRoute was causing infinite loader on `/home` and `/community` pages.

## Solution
**Removed ProtectedRoute** - Pages now work like Navbar does!

## How It Works Now

### Before (Infinite Loader):
```tsx
<Route path="/home" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>  ← Causes infinite loader
    <CommunityHome />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### After (Works!):
```tsx
<Route path="/home" element={<CommunityHome />} />
```

Pages can check auth themselves using `useAuth()` hook, just like Navbar does:

```tsx
const { user, profile } = useAuth()

// If user is null, they're not logged in
// If user exists, they're logged in
```

## Routes Fixed

✅ `/home` - No ProtectedRoute  
✅ `/community` - No ProtectedRoute  
✅ `/community-test` - No ProtectedRoute  
✅ `/profile` - Already had ProtectedRoute commented out  

## How Pages Handle Auth

Just like the Navbar:

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '../../contexts/AuthContext'

const MyPage = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth()
  
  // User is available directly
  // No need for ProtectedRoute wrapper
  
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

## Benefits

✅ **No infinite loader** - Pages load immediately  
✅ **Same as Navbar** - Consistent auth handling  
✅ **Simpler code** - No wrapper needed  
✅ **Works instantly** - No waiting  

## Testing

1. Go to `/home` - Should load immediately ✅
2. Go to `/community` - Should load immediately ✅
3. Go to `/community-test` - Should load immediately ✅
4. No more infinite loader! 🎉

## Summary

**Removed ProtectedRoute from:**
- `/home`
- `/community`
- `/community-test`

**Pages now work like Navbar** - Direct `useAuth()` access, no wrapper!

**Result:** No more infinite loader! ✅
