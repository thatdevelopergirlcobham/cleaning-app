# CleanCal - Community Waste Management Platform

CleanCal is a comprehensive, community-driven waste management platform designed to leverage technology to transform Calabar, Nigeria, into a cleaner, greener city. Our mission is to bridge the gap between residents and waste management authorities through real-time data and actionable community engagement.

## The Two-Sided Solution

The CleanCal platform operates with two distinct interfaces, ensuring both community participation and strategic management:

### The Community User Platform (The Action Loop)

This side empowers every resident to be a part of the solution:

- **Real-Time Reporting**: Users can submit detailed Waste Reports (with photo and precise GPS location) via a dedicated mobile-first interface. All new reports are initially marked as pending.
- **Actionable Feed**: The main dashboard displays a social-like feed showing ONLY approved and resolved issues, fostering a sense of progress and accomplishment.
- **Community Events**: Users can create or join cleanup events coordinated directly through the application.
- **Agent Hiring**: Residents can utilize a dedicated service to hire certified CleanCal agents for aid with larger or complex cleanups.

### The Admin Management Platform (The Verification Loop)

Accessible only by designated administrators, this side ensures quality control and resource efficiency:

- **Verification Dashboard**: Admins review all newly submitted (pending) reports. This crucial step validates the report's accuracy before it becomes visible on the public map or feed.
- **Status Management**: Admins can change a report's status to approved (making it actionable for the community/agents) or rejected.
- **Resource Oversight**: Management tools allow admins to track all open Agent Bookings, manage user roles, and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) like resolution rates and total active reports.

## üéØ Our Vision

CleanCal is built on a SaaS model foundation with Supabase providing robust authentication and real-time data handling. Our ultimate goal is to create a sustainable environmental impact by turning passive observation into collective, measurable action, helping to realize the vision of Calabar as the cleanest city in Nigeria.

## üåç AI Integration (Gemini AI Assistant)

Integrate Google Gemini API (placeholder setup for now, developer will later add key). The AI assistant‚Äînamed "EcoBot"‚Äîhelps users and admins by:

- Providing eco tips and waste sorting recommendations.
- Giving contextual insights when reviewing reports (e.g., "This area often reports plastic waste, recommend recycling center X").
- Suggesting community event ideas and improvement insights.

For admins, EcoBot suggests response templates, KPI interpretations, and agent task optimization.

### üß† AI Accessibility

AI should be accessible from:
- A floating chatbot icon on all pages.
- A side panel accessible in both Community and Admin dashboards.
- Optional AI summary box under approved reports (e.g., "EcoBot's Insight: Compost organic waste nearby‚Ä¶").

## üé® Design System

### Font Family
- Use "Inter" (primary) ‚Äî clean, techy, and accessible.
- Use "Outfit" for headers to give a smooth eco-modern vibe.

### Color Palette
- **Primary Green**: #16A34A (Emerald Green ‚Äî symbolizing freshness & eco-focus)
- **Secondary Blue**: #2563EB (Trust and technology)
- **Accent Yellow**: #FACC15 (Energy & call-to-action)
- **Neutral Background**: #F9FAFB
- **Text**: #1E293B
- **Error**: #DC2626, **Success**: #22C55E, **Info**: #3B82F6

### UI Design Rules
- Use rounded-2xl corners for all cards, modals, and buttons.
- Shadow-sm on hover, shadow-md for modals.
- Keep spacing uniform (p-4, p-6, gap-4, etc.).
- Define all colors and font sizes in tailwind.config.js.
- Maintain light/dark mode (dark uses deeper greens and neutral gray backgrounds).
- Consistent button variants: primary, secondary, outline, and ghost.

## üîî Custom Toaster (Reusable Component)

Create a custom toaster system for uniform notifications:

- **File**: `/src/components/common/Toaster.tsx`
- Use React Context to handle global toast queue.
- Supports variants: success, error, info, warning.
- Animations via Tailwind transitions (slide-up/fade-in).
- Auto-dismiss after 5s; manual close option.
- Accessible (aria-live, role="alert").
- Expose helper hook useToast() for usage in forms and actions.
