## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Run These SQL Scripts in Supabase

### Step 1: Storage Policies (Already Done âœ…)
Your storage is working! Skip this.

### Step 2: Reports Table Policies (MUST DO NOW!)

**Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor and run this:**

```sql
-- Enable RLS on reports table
ALTER TABLE reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own reports" ON reports;

-- Allow anyone to view all reports
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view reports"
ON reports FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to insert reports
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert reports"
ON reports FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to update their own reports
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own reports"
ON reports FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to delete their own reports
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own reports"
ON reports FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
